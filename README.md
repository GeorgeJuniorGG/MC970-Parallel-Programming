# MC970 - Parallel Programming

Welcome to the repository for **MC970 - Parallel Programming**, a course focused on learning and applying parallel programming techniques. This repository contains exercises and the final project developed during the course.

---

## üìö **Table of Contents**
- **[`pthreads/`](./pthreads/)**: Exercises demonstrating parallel programming using **POSIX Threads (pthreads)**.
- **[`OpenMP/`](./OpenMP/)**: Exercises focused on **OpenMP**, a parallel programming API for shared memory architectures.
- **[`CUDA/`](./CUDA/)**: Exercises exploring **CUDA**, a parallel computing platform and API for NVIDIA GPUs.
- **[`Final Project/`](./Final%20Project/)**: The final project where **Huffman encoding** is parallelized using the techniques learned during the course.

## üéØ **Final Project: Parallelizing Huffman Encoding**
The final project involves parallelizing the **Huffman encoding** algorithm, a popular lossless data compression method. The implementation demonstrates:
- Parallelization of the encoding process.
- Performance comparisons between sequential and parallel implementations.
